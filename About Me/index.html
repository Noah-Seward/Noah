I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I found this project to be really fun! For the most part it was very simple
and any questions I had were answered with a quick google search. I feel like I did my table wrong just cause it
took up so much space. I think there may be a simplier way of doing this but I don't know. I liked adding color and
different formats to my website.

        <!-- My Interests. Has to be 3 paragraphs.-->
        <h2>My Hobbies/Interests:</h2>
        <p>
            I'm very interested in computers and programming obviously. I love making something from nothing and being able to make whatever I want.
            I also love the feeling of accomplishing something difficult that I thought I couldn't do before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like planes. My dream job was to become a pilot in the Airforce, but because of medical conditions, I can't do that. My favorite plane is the FA-22 Raptor.
            Because of my love for planes, I know almost nothing about cars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I love just doing and learning random things. This includes things like darts, Rubix Cube, magic, chess, juggling, and lots more. I just find them interesting
            and they are very entertaining. I also just like having something new to learn and do.
